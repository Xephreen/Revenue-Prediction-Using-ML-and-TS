# Revenue-Trends-Forecasting-using-ML-and-TS
This project focused on developing machine learning and time series skills to predict a company's revenue. I explored forecasting models like ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM, applied them to historical data, evaluated performance using MAE and RMSE, and proposed improvements for better accuracy and integration into decision-making processes.
